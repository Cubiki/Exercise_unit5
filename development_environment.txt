A development environment is a collection of procedures and tools for developing, testing and debugging an 
application or program.

The development environment normally has three server tiers, called development, staging and production. 
All three tiers together are usually referred to as the DSP.

Development Server: Here is where the developer tests code and checks whether the application runs successfully 
with that code. Once the application has been tested and the developer feels that the code is working fine, the 
application then moves to the staging server.

Staging Server:This environment is made to look exactly like the production server environment. The application is 
tested on the staging server to check for reliability and to make sure it does not fail on the actual production 
server. This type of testing on the staging server is the final step before the application could be deployed on 
a production server. The application needs to be approved in order to deploy it on the production server.

Production Server: Once the approval is done, the application then becomes a part of this server.
